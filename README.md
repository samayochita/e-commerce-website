Ecommerce website


Milestone-1 (HTML, CSS): Created a responsive e-commerce web application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap containers, flexbox, and grid, inspired by user-friendly interfaces from reference websites like Meesho, OLX, and Urban Ladder. Implemented static pages for product listing, product details, cart, and profile.

Milestone-2 (React JS): Transformed the static application into a dynamic React web app. Task-1 involved porting HTML/CSS pages to React, incorporating routing for seamless navigation. Task-2 enhanced interactivity:

Product Listing: Fetches product list from the server, enabling dynamic content.
Product Details: Retrieves product details from the server, allowing actions like adding to cart, leaving reviews, and providing ratings.
Cart Page: Dynamically updates cart details from the server, with features like quantity adjustment affecting total prices.
Profile Page: Maintained simplicity without dynamic elements for streamlined functionality.
This project showcases a progressive transition from static to dynamic web development using React, emphasizing reusable components and server interaction for a more robust e-commerce experience.
